We have conducted an initial user driven evaluation of the tool. For this preliminary evaluation we keep the number of evaluators low; seven ontology engineers used our plugin and gave us an insight on their experience by filling in a questionnaire \footnote{\url{http://goo.gl/H4YgBJ}}. The results indicate that while the tool needs some minor improvements, the majority of the evaluators still consider the tool to be useful.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusions}
In this paper we have presented (1) initial guidelines that describe how to reuse available vocabularies at low fine grained level,i.e., reusing specific classes and properties, and (2) a tool that provides technological support by means of a plugin for \protege that access LOV API. As future work we plan to fully evaluate the tool and guidelines.
