Prot{\'e}g{\'e} is one the popular framework for developing ontologies in a variety of formats including OWL, RDF(S), and XML Schema. It is backed by a strong community of developers and users in many domains. One success on Prot{\'e}g{\'e} also lies on the availability to extend the core framework adding new functionalities by means of plug-ins.

At the same time, the recent success of Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV) as a central point for curated catalog of ontologies is helping to convey on best practices to publish vocabularies on the Web, as well as to help in the Data publication activity on the Web. LOV comes with many features, such as an API, a search function and a SPARQL endpoint.
 
We propose in this paper to explore, design and implement a plug-in of LOV in Prot{\'e}g{\'e} for easing the development of ontologies by reusing existing vocabularies. 
The tool has to improve the modeling and reuse of ontologies used in the LOD cloud, by providing the following features in Prot{\'e}g{\'e}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Import easily vocabularies from LOV into Prot{\'e}g{\'e}. 
\item Propose to the user a list of candidate vocabularies in LOV matching the term
\item Have an updating mechanism (synchronization) to LOV catalog
\item Check if a new vocabulary created in Prot{\'e}g{\'e} satisfied the LOV recommendations

\item Suggest to LOV a new created vocabulary within Prot{\'e}g{\'e}.
\end{itemize}

 This paper presents Prot{\'e}g{\'e}, a first implementation of the LOV realized as a plugin for the ontology editor Prot{\'e}g{\'e}.
